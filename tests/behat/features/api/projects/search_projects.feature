Feature: Search projects

  To find programs, users should be able to search all available programs for specific words

  Background:
    Given there are users:
      | name     | password | token      | id |
      | Catrobat | 12345    | cccccccccc | 1  |

  Scenario: Search for projects with specific word

    Given I have a parameter "query_string" with value "Galaxy"
    And I have a request header "HTTP_ACCEPT" with value "application/json"
    And I request "GET" "/api/projects/search"
    Then The response status code should be "200"
    Then The response should have the projects model structure
    Then The response should contain total projects with value 1
    Then The response should contain projects in the following order:
      | Name      |
      | Galaxy War|

  Scenario: Search for projects with specific user

    Given I have a parameter "query_string" with value "User1"
    And I have a request header "HTTP_ACCEPT" with value "application/json"
    And I request "GET" "/api/projects/search"
    Then The response status code should be "200"
    Then The response should have the projects model structure
    Then The response should contain total projects with value 2
    Then The response should contain projects in the following order:
      | Name      |
      | Superponny|
      | Galaxy War|

  Scenario: Private projects must not appear in the results

    Given I have a parameter "query_string" with value "Fisch"
    And I have a request header "HTTP_ACCEPT" with value "application/json"
    And I request "GET" "/api/projects/search"
    Then The response status code should be "200"
    Then The response should have the projects model structure
    Then I should get the json object:
      """
      {
        "projects": [],
        "total_results": 0
      }
      """

  Scenario: Hidden projects must not appear in the results

    Given I have a parameter "query_string" with value "Ponny description2"
    And I have a request header "HTTP_ACCEPT" with value "application/json"
    And I request "GET" "/api/projects/search"
    Then The response status code should be "200"
    Then The response should have the projects model structure
    Then I should get the json object:
      """
      {
        "projects": [],
        "total_results": 0
      }
      """

  Scenario: Search for project using the limit query, total project value must be the overall result count without limit

    Given I have a parameter "query_string" with value "NewUser"
    And I have a parameter "limit" with value "2"
    And I have a request header "HTTP_ACCEPT" with value "application/json"
    And I request "GET" "/api/projects/search"
    Then The response status code should be "200"
    Then The response should have the projects model structure
    Then The response should contain total projects with value 4
    Then The response should contain projects in the following order:
      | Name      |
      | Webteam   |
      | Ponny     |

  Scenario: Search for project using the offset query

    Given I have a parameter "query_string" with value "description"
    And I have a parameter "offset" with value "1"
    And I have a request header "HTTP_ACCEPT" with value "application/json"
    And I request "GET" "/api/projects/search"
    Then The response status code should be "200"
    Then The response should have the projects model structure
    Then The response should contain total projects with value 2
    Then The response should contain projects in the following order:
      | Name      |
      | Galaxy War|

  Scenario: Search for project with specific extension

    Given I have a parameter "query_string" with value "Arduino"
    And I have a request header "HTTP_ACCEPT" with value "application/json"
    And I request "GET" "/api/projects/search"
    Then The response status code should be "200"
    Then The response should have the projects model structure
    Then The response should contain total projects with value 2
    Then The response should contain projects in the following order:
      | Name      |
      | Ponny     |
      | Galaxy War|
